    <h1>Welcome to The Unseminarian</h1>

    <p>
        This space is a creative blog where I’m documenting my growth as I learn to know God more deeply.
        Jesus says in the Gospel of John that eternal life is this: to know God and to know His Son.
        That journey begins now and continues forever, and this website is simply my attempt to trace that path.
    </p>

    <p>
        The name <strong>The Unseminarian</strong> reflects who I am. I’m not formally trained in theology—
        my background is in architecture. I don’t write as a scholar or an expert, but as someone who loves God,
        loves learning about Him, and wants to grow in understanding. I hold no authority; this is just a place
        to record my pursuit of knowing God, and maybe something here will help someone else along the way.
    </p>

    <p>
        I grew up in a Christian home, and during a difficult season surrounding my parents’ divorce,
        I learned early what it meant to cling to God. Since then, my relationship with Christ has continued to grow.
        I was raised in a small Nazarene church, though I don’t feel tied to any denomination now.
        I’m also a husband to a wonderful wife and, Lord willing, a future dad.
